## Business Task

Danny wants to use data captured from a few months of operations to find out more about his customers, especially their visiting patterns, how much money they spent, and which menu items are their favorite. He plans to use these insights to decide whether he should expand the existing customer loyalty program- additionally he needs help to generate basic datasets so his team can easily inspect the data.

FROM dannys_diner.sales
LEFT JOIN dannys_diner.members
	ON sales.customer_id = members.customer_id
INNER JOIN dannys_diner.menu
	ON sales.product_id = menu.product_id
ORDER BY members.customer_id, sales.order_date
```

**Rank All The Things**

Danny also requires further information about the ranking of customer products, but he purposely does not need the ranking for non-member purchases so he expects **null** ranking values for the records when customers are not yet part of the program.

**Answer:**

```sql
WITH customers_data AS (
	SELECT
		sales.customer_id,
    	sales.order_date, 
    	menu.product_name,
    	menu.price,
    	CASE
    		WHEN members.join_Date > sales.order_date THEN 'N'
        	WHEN members.join_date <= sales.order_date THEN 'Y'
        	ELSE 'N' END AS member_status
	FROM dannys_diner.sales
	LEFT JOIN dannys_diner.members
		ON sales.customer_id = members.customer_id
	INNER JOIN dannys_diner.menu
		ON sales.product_id = menu.product_id
)

SELECT
	*,
    CASE 
    	WHEN member_status = 'N' then NULL
        ELSE RANK () OVER(
          PARTITION BY customer_id, member_status
          ORDER BY order_date
    ) END AS ranking
FROM customers_data
```

|customer_id|order_date|product_name|price|member_status|ranking|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|A|2021-01-01|sushi|10|N|null|
|A|2021-01-01|curry|15|N|null|
