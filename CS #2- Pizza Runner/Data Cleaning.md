# 🧼 Data Cleaning

## Table: customer_orders

To clean up this table, we need to remove the null values from the **exclusions** column and the **extras** column:

```sql
CREATE TABLE customer_orders_fix AS
SELECT
	order_id,
    customer_id,
    pizza_id,
    CASE 
    	WHEN exclusions IS null OR exclusions LIKE 'null' THEN ' '
        ELSE exclusions END AS exclusions,
    CASE 
    	WHEN extras IS null OR extras LIKE 'null' THEN ' '
        ELSE extras END AS extras,
    order_time
FROM pizza_runner.customer_orders;
```

This is what the table would look like after being cleaned:

| order_id | customer_id | pizza_id | exclusions | extras | order_time          |
| -------- | ----------- | -------- | ---------- | ------ | ------------------- |
| 1        | 101         | 1        |            |        | 2020-01-01 18:05:02 |

## Table: runner_orders

To clean up this table, we need to:
- remove the null values from the **pickup_time**, **distance**, **duration**, and **cancellation columns**
- remove the 'km' in the **distance** column
- remove 'minutes', 'minute', and 'mins' from the **duration** column

```sql
CREATE TABLE runner_orders_fix AS
SELECT
	order_id,
    runner_id,
    CASE 
    	WHEN pickup_time IS null OR pickup_time LIKE 'null' THEN ' '
        ELSE pickup_time END AS pickup_time,
    CASE
    	WHEN distance IS null OR distance LIKE 'null' THEN ' '
        WHEN distance LIKE '%km' THEN TRIM('km' FROM distance)
        ELSE distance END AS distance,
    CASE
    	WHEN duration IS null OR duration LIKE 'null' THEN ' '
        WHEN duration LIKE '%minutes' THEN TRIM('minutes' FROM duration)
        WHEN duration LIKE '%minute' THEN TRIM('minute' FROM duration)
        WHEN duration LIKE '%mins' THEN TRIM('mins' FROM duration)
        ELSE duration END AS duration,
    CASE
    	WHEN cancellation IS null or cancellation LIKE 'null' THEN ' '
        ELSE cancellation END AS cancellation
FROM runner_orders;
```

This is what the table would look like after being cleaned:

| order_id | runner_id | pickup_time         | distance | duration | cancellation            |
| -------- | --------- | ------------------- | -------- | -------- | ----------------------- |

| 3        | 1         | 2020-01-03 00:12:37 | 13.4     | 20       |                         |

| 6        | 3         |                     |          |          | Restaurant Cancellation |
| 7        | 2         | 2020-01-08 21:30:45 | 25       | 25       |                         |
